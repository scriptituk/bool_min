# Minimisation of boolean functions

## A vintage PL/I implementation from 1986 brought back to life!

### Background
This was my final-year BSc project at Bristol Polytechnic, now [UWE Bristol](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/) (University of the West of England).
My course was Electrical Engineering
but they allowed me do a 100% software project because it related to electronics:
the design and implementation of minimal logic circuitry.

### Concept

This is a version of the Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm
which incorporates algebraic operations proposed by Nagle at al for improved efficiency
(ref. *An Introduction to Computer Logic; H.T.Nagle, B.D.CARROLL & J.D.Irwin; Prentice-Hall, 1975*).

### Implementation

It was coded in [PL/I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I) General Purpose Subset,
a subset of ANSI Standard PL/I initially developed by IBM,
and ran on a 1979 PR1ME 550 System by [Prime Computer, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer)
running the [PRIMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRIMOS) operating system accessed by dumb terminals.

PL/I was chosen because it can do bitwise logical operations on varying-length bit strings,
rather than deploying arrays of fixed-length integers.
In its day it was a good choice for scientific, engineering and system programming.

The [program source code](1986/1986-bool_min.pli)
derives from the original line printer [listing](1986/1986-list-lineprint.pdf)
via scanning, optical character recognition and extensive correction
(OCR does not handle dot-matrix type well).
The [test runs](1986/1986-runs-lineprint.pdf) were also scanned.

Recently (2024) I managed to get the program running again using
the [Iron Spring PL/I compiler](http://www.iron-spring.com/) introduced in 2007,
on Ubuntu Linux under [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on a Mac Pro.

I shall publish the amended source code here
when minor outstanding compiler compatibility issues are fixed.

### Purpose

This project is not intended as a solution for modern applications.
It is presented for historic interest and to demonstrate the algebraic method of prime implicant production.
